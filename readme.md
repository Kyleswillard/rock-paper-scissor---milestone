#Rock Paper Scissor JS Demo

#Introduction
I decided after I completed this exercise to add it to a github repo. I chose to do so, and will likely have other simple examples due to the fact that this is from my own brain with only research to find specific info, not a copy paste from someone elses tutorial, ect. I feel that as with everyone that there should be celebrations at milestones. For me this is a milestone.

#Instructions
To play reload page. Each reload will translate into a new game, long term I may add a win/loss log and buttons. For now each game = a reload.
